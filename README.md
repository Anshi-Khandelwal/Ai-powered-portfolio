## 🧠 What I Learned
Using V0.dev was a fun and rewarding experience. I explored how to use plain English prompts to generate clean, component-based React code. I also learned how to iterate on spacing, structure, responsiveness, and animations. One feature I loved was the premium Figma integration — as someone who loves working in Figma, seeing AI turn designs into code felt like a dream!
